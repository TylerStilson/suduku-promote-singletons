<p>In this step you will solve squares whose pencil marks indicate that
only one value is possible in the square, something we will call a
pencil mark singleton. For example, if a group looks like:</p>

<pre><code>+-----------------------+
| . . . |       | . . . |
| . 5 .     6     . . . |
| 7 . . |       | 7 . . |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 . | . . . | 1 . . |
| . 5 .   . 5 .   . . . |
| 7 8 9 | 7 8 9 | 7 8 9 |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 3 | . . 3 |       |
| . . .   . . .     4   |
| 7 . 9 | 7 . 9 |       |
+-----------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Then you will solve the square where the pencil marks show that 7 is
the only possible solution:</p>

<pre><code>+-----------------------+
| . . . |       |       |
| . 5 .     6       7   |
| 7 . . |       |       |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 . | . . . | 1 . . |
| . 5 .   . 5 .   . . . |
| 7 8 9 | 7 8 9 | 7 8 9 |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 3 | . . 3 |       |
| . . .   . . .     4   |
| 7 . 9 | 7 . 9 |       |
+-----------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>You will not be considering rows, columns, or groups in this step,
you will just consider each pencil-mark square on the entire board
in turn.</p>

<p>Note that in this case the pencil marks need to be updated because
of the newly-solved square:</p>

<pre><code>+-----------------------+
| . . . |       |       |
| . 5 .     6       7   |
| . . . |       |       |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 . | . . . | 1 . . |
| . 5 .   . 5 .   . . . |
| . 8 9 | . 8 9 | . 8 9 |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 3 | . . 3 |       |
| . . .   . . .     4   |
| . . 9 | . . 9 |       |
+-----------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>This, in turn, exposes another pencil mark singleton in the top-left
corner. Solving it and re-computing the pencil marks yields:</p>

<pre><code>+-----------------------+
|       |       |       |
|   5       6       7   |
|       |       |       |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 . | . . . | 1 . . |
| . . .   . . .   . . . |
| . 8 9 | . 8 9 | . 8 9 |
| - - - + - - - + - - - |
| 1 2 3 | . . 3 |       |
| . . .   . . .     4   |
| . . 9 | . . 9 |       |
+-----------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>At a high level, the function <code>promote_pencil_singletons</code> does the
following:</p>

<pre><code>promote_pencil_singletons(*board, *table):
    loop over all 81 positions of the board:
        if the position is a pencil mark:
            count the &#34;possible&#34; marks
            if there was exactly one, solve the position
    if there were any changes made:
        call calc_pencil(board, table)
        repeat the entire process
    return 1 if any changes were made, 0 otherwise
</code></pre>

<p>To count the possible marks in a square, you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>count = 0
n = 0
for i from 1 to 9:
    if (elt &amp; (1&lt;&lt;i)) != 0:
        count += 1
        n = i
if count == 1:
    set board position to n
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we count the number of possible values by trying
each one out. We also use <code>n</code> to record the most recent value we
discovered. If there was only one possible value, then <code>n</code> will
capture it.</p>

<p>You will also need to think about the remaining structure of the
function. Make sure you have considered all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can assume <code>calc_pencil</code> was called before
<code>promote_pencil_singletons</code></p></li>

<li><p>If you make no changes, you should return 0. In this case the
board should be exactly as it was when you were called. You
should not call <code>calc_pencil</code> in this case.</p></li>

<li><p>If you make any changes, then after processing the entire board
you should call <code>calc_pencil</code> to re-compute the pencil marks and
then check if that opened up any new singletons. When you
eventually return, the pencil marks should all be up-to-date as
a result.</p></li>

<li><p>You may end up repeating this cycle many times (promote
singletons, re-calculate pencil marks, find more singletons,
etc.). You should return 1 at the end if you made any changes,
regardless of how many times the cycle repeated. This can be
implemented with another loop at the top level.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can test your code using:</p>

<pre><code>make test
</code></pre>

<p>to run the unit tests as usual. You can also use:</p>

<pre><code>make run
</code></pre>

<p>and then type in a sample board. In this case <code>main</code> will read the
board, calculate pencil marks, call your code, and print the board
at various stages.</p>

<pre><code>make debug
</code></pre>

<p>This will enter the debugger using the same code path as &#34;make run&#34;.</p>
